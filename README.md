# MZF2WAVGUI
Uses MZF2WAV to convert mzf files for Sharp MZ computers to wav file and allows you to play them. A bit like a tape emulator to use with MZs.

It use Jeroen Laros's 15 year old MZF to WAV convertor command but add as fancy new GUI. 

How to use:
            Load an MZF file (freely available on the interenet or one of the builtin ones)
            Save the File to WAV format locally or to media player
            Play the WAV file from your PC audio through an audio cable attached to your Sharp MZ computer
