# MZF2WAVGUI
Uses MZF2WAV to convert mzf files for Sharp MZ computers to wav file and allows you to play them. A bit like a tape emulator to use with MZs.

It uses Jeroen Laros's 15 year old MZF to WAV convertor command but adds a fancy new GUI. 

How to use:

            Unzip MZF2WAVGUI and install the setup.exe
            
            Load an MZF file (freely available on the interenet or one of the builtin ones)
            
            Save the File to WAV format locally or to media player
            
            Play the WAV file from your PC audio through an audio cable attached to your Sharp MZ computer

            If you are planning to use an MZuiTape device use the -c and -b option
            
            v1.5 now has batch conversion mode to convert multiple files in one job. I've attached a video showing how it works.
