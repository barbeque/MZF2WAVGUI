# MZF2WAVGUI
Uses MZF2WAV to convert mzf/mzt files for Sharp MZ computers to wav file and allows you to play them. A bit like a tape emulator to use with MZs.

It uses Jeroen Laros's 15 year old MZF to WAV convertor command but adds a fancy new GUI. Thanks Jeroen for your support
Thanks Bernd Kr√ºger-Knauber for permission to use MZTtoMZF for mzt conversion

How to use:

            Unzip MZF2WAVGUI and install the setup.exe
            
            PLEASE BACKUP YOUR MZ FILES BEFORE USE
            
            Load an MZF/MZT file (freely available on the interenet or one of the builtin ones)
            
            Save the File to WAV format locally or to media player
            
            If you are planning to use an MZuiTape device use the -c and -b or the MZuiTape option
            
            v1.5 now has batch conversion mode to convert multiple files in one job. I've attached a video showing how it works.
            
            V1.5.5 Now supports MZT files
            
            If you would like to purchase a MZuiTape device contact me on info@youmakerobots.com
